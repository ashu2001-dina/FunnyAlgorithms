# Hash Prefix Calculator

This C++ program calculates hash prefixes for a given string using modular arithmetic. The hash prefixes are calculated based on a prime base 'p', a prime modulus 'm', and the input string 's'.

## Overview

The provided C++ code includes a function `calculateHashPrefixes` that takes a string as input and computes hash prefixes for each character using the formula:
